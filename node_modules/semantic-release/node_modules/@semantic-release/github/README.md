## Install

```bash
$ npm install @semantic-release/github -D
```

## Usage

The plugin can be configured in the [**semantic-release** configuration file](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md#configuration):

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
    "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
    ["@semantic-release/github", {
      "assets": [
        {"path": "dist/asset.min.css", "label": "CSS distribution"},
        {"path": "dist/asset.min.js", "label": "JS distribution"}
      ]
    }],
  ]
}
```

With this example [GitHub releases](https://help.github.com/articles/about-releases) will be published with the file `dist/asset.min.css` and `dist/asset.min.js`.

## Configuration

### GitHub authentication

The GitHub authentication configuration is **required** and can be set via [environment variables](#environment-variables).

Follow the [Creating a personal access token for the command line](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) documentation to obtain an authentication token. The token has to be made available in your CI environment via the `GH_TOKEN` environment variable. The user associated with the token must have push permission to the repository.

When creating the token, the **minimum required scopes** are:

- [`repo`](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo) for a private repository
- [`public_repo`](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=public_repo) for a public repository

_Note on GitHub Actions:_ You can use the default token which is provided in  the secret _GITHUB_TOKEN_. However releases done with this token will NOT trigger release events to start other workflows.
If you have actions that trigger on newly created releases, please use a generated token for that and store it in your repository's secrets (any other name than GITHUB_TOKEN is fine).

### Environment variables

See [node-https-proxy-agent](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent#new-httpsproxyagentobject-options) and [node-http-proxy-agent](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-http-proxy-agent) for additional details.

##### proxy examples

`'http://168.63.76.32:3128'`: use the proxy running on host `168.63.76.32` and port `3128` for each GitHub API request.
`{host: '168.63.76.32', port: 3128, headers: {Foo: 'bar'}}`: use the proxy running on host `168.63.76.32` and port `3128` for each GitHub API request, setting the `Foo` header value to `bar`.

#### assets

Can be a [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer) or and `Array` of
[globs](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer) and `Object`s with the following properties:

| Property | Description                                                                                              | Default                              |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `path`   | **Required.** A [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer) to identify the files to upload. | -                                    |
| `name`   | The name of the downloadable file on the GitHub release.                                                 | File name extracted from the `path`. |
| `label`  | Short description of the file displayed on the GitHub release.                                           | -                                    |

Each entry in the `assets` `Array` is globbed individually. A [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer)
can be a `String` (`"dist/**/*.js"` or `"dist/mylib.js"`) or an `Array` of `String`s that will be globbed together
(`["dist/**", "!**/*.css"]`).

If a directory is configured, all the files under this directory and its children will be included.

The `name` and `label` for each assets are generated with [Lodash template](https://lodash.com/docs#template). The following variables are available:

| Parameter     | Description                                                                         |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `branch`      | The branch from which the release is done.                                          |
| `lastRelease` | `Object` with `version`, `gitTag` and `gitHead` of the last release.                |
| `nextRelease` | `Object` with `version`, `gitTag`, `gitHead` and `notes` of the release being done. |
| `commits`     | `Array` of commit `Object`s with `hash`, `subject`, `body` `message` and `author`.  |

**Note**: If a file has a match in `assets` it will be included even if it also has a match in `.gitignore`.

##### assets examples

`'dist/*.js'`: include all the `js` files in the `dist` directory, but not in its sub-directories.

`[['dist', '!**/*.css']]`: include all the files in the `dist` directory and its sub-directories excluding the `css`
files.

`[{path: 'dist/MyLibrary.js', label: 'MyLibrary JS distribution'}, {path: 'dist/MyLibrary.css', label: 'MyLibrary CSS
distribution'}]`: include the `dist/MyLibrary.js` and `dist/MyLibrary.css` files, and label them `MyLibrary JS
distribution` and `MyLibrary CSS distribution` in the GitHub release.

`[['dist/**/*.{js,css}', '!**/*.min.*'], {path: 'build/MyLibrary.zip', label: 'MyLibrary'}]`: include all the `js` and
`css` files in the `dist` directory and its sub-directories excluding the minified version, plus the
`build/MyLibrary.zip` file and label it `MyLibrary` in the GitHub release.

`[{path: 'dist/MyLibrary.js', name: 'MyLibrary-${nextRelease.gitTag}.js', label: 'MyLibrary JS (${nextRelease.gitTag}) distribution'}]`: include the file `dist/MyLibrary.js` and upload it to the GitHub release with name `MyLibrary-v1.0.0.js` and label `MyLibrary JS (v1.0.0) distribution` which will generate the link:

> `[MyLibrary JS (v1.0.0) distribution](MyLibrary-v1.0.0.js)`
