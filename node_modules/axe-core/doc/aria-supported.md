# ARIA Roles and Attributes unsupported in axe-core.

It can be difficult to know which features of web technologies are accessible across different platforms, and with different screen readers and other assistive technologies. Axe-core does some of this work for you, by raising issues when accessibility features are used that are known to cause problems.

This page contains a list of ARIA 1.1 features that axe-core raises as unsupported. For more information, read [We’ve got your back with “Accessibility Supported” in axe](https://www.deque.com/blog/weve-got-your-back-with-accessibility-supported-in-axe/).

For a detailed description about how accessibility support is decided, see [How we make decisions on rules](accessibility-supported.md).
